    "# TextRank\n",
    "- TextRank is an unsupervised method for extracting keywords and sentences. It is based on a graph where each node is a word, and edges represent relationships between words which are formed by defining the co-occurrence of words within a moving window of a predetermined size. The algorithm is inspired by PageRank which was used by Google to rank websites. It first Tokenizes and annotates text with Part of Speech (PoS). It only considers single words. However, no n-grams are used, multi-words are reconstructed later. An edge is created if lexical units co-occur within a window of N-words to obtain an unweighted undirected graph. Then it runs the text rank algorithm to rank the words. The most important lexical words are selected and then adjacent keywords are folded into a multi-word keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To generate keywords using Textrank you must first install the summa package and then module keywords must be imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``` pip install summa```\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```from summa import keywords```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, you simply have to call the keyword function and pass the text to be handled to it. Weâ€™ll also set the scores to true to print out the relevance of each resulting keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```TR_keywords = keywords.keywords(full_text, scores=True)```\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```print(TR_keywords[0:10])```"
