    summary:
      "In this aspect, diffusion models\nare a better candidate for human motion generation, as they are free from assumptions on the target\ndistribution, and are known for expressing well the many-to-many distribution matching problem\nwe have described.\n for the recently emerging\ntext-to-motion setting, where motion is generated from natural language, another inherent problem\nis data labeling. diffusion models (sohl-dickstein et al., 2015; song & ermon, 2020; ho et in this paper, we introduce motion diffusion model (mdm),\na carefully adapted classiÔ¨Åer-free diffusion-based generative model for the hu-\nman motion domain.",
